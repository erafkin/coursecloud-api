workload is pretty high but i think everything helps you learn the material better and prepare for the test so didn\'t mind it much. however the quizzes did feel kind of rapid fire especially at the end of the course i think it would be helpful to have less work/less assignments going on because it all gets very overwhelming. – ideal. 4 quizzes (drop lowest) and a final. Lots of labs (not hard) and a couple tiny problem sets (both labs and PSets have answers uploaded tho). 4 quizzes (lowest dropped). 1 Final. 6 STATA labs. 1 group research paper. 4 Conceptual PSets. Everyone gets 100 on everything besides one lab, the research paper, quizzes, and final. 4 quizzes (lowest score dropped), 1 final exam, 6 labs and 4 conceptual exercises, a final project.  It takes more time to complete all the assignment than in other typical Dartmouth classes, but most are done in class, so the workload is definitely manageable. 4 quizzes where you can drop the lowest, labs, some problem sets, a final group project and a final exam. 4 quizzes, drop lowest . 1 final . the rest doesn\'t really matter. A lot of weight ends up falling on the final exam. Heavy workload, but worth the time. A lot of work, frequent quizzes, and high expectations, but all fair. Exams are the major indication of comprehension but extra grades to help boost. Four quizzes, one project, one final, homework for clnpletion. Frequent quizzes, while difficult, helped me learn the material better, I thought. Good. But multiple choice unreasonably tough at times - deliberately made to confuse students and make them doubt.  The class is very hard and extremely demanding - especially compared to the summer econ 20. As such, a B median is extremely unfair and it feels that students are unfairly punished for making mistakes as they try to get to grips with tough material. Great, too many tests/exams. Tricky grading - because we are each able to drop one quiz, this could disadvantage students that do well on all four quizzes or one who did well above the median on a quiz that the rest did worse on, as it is the raw score and not how much better you do relative to others that is considered when dropping quizzes. I really like that there were four quizzes, rather than one big midterm, and that we could drop our lowest score. I also really liked that we had extra problem sets to not only boost our grade, but help us get a grip on the material. The tests were definitely hard, but fair. I think that overall, the workload was manageable. I thought the workload was very fair. All of the small assignments forced me to stay on top of the material. As I mentioned earlier, I think some of the questions were unnecessarily nitpicky and not necessarily the best measure of understanding. It was a pretty substantial workload, but a lot of the assignments were based on completion so as long as you were thorough it was manageable. It was pretty tough to have so many exams. Methods of evaluation are all appropriate.Quizzes were fair and the workload just right. Quizzes were very high pressure. I would add some other assignments and possibly take away one of the quizzes. This class, along with the constant assignments, was a TON of work. Tests and group project. Plenty of practice tests available. Workload is high though. Tests and quizzes were hard! Tests were fair, though i thought quiz #3 this term was a bit out of the blue (seemed like it tested more quiz #4 topics than quiz #3 topics). Otherwise, everything was fair, and final exam was very good overall representation of course. Tests, labs, problem sets. Tests, projects, weekly assignments. The methods of evaluation the professor chose (Tests, labs, conceptual exercises) were a lot in quantity, but were greatly effective in reinforcing the concepts and helping relieve the stress of doing well in the class. The tests were fair and there are a lot of practice exams to help. The widely varying difficulty of the quizzes made the dropping a quiz technique unhelpful to students who were consistent across their quizzes or who did relatively well on the harder quizzes. The workload was a lot. The RD lab being assigned at the same time as the final stages of the group project and the final exam was very stressful. There wasn\'t enough time between quiz 4 and the final exam to do a comprehensive study/review. Very fair, wish the final wasn\'t weighted so heavily though when there are four quizzes. Workload was not too much. I thought the quizzes and assignments were appropriately difficult and interesting. Your grade sort of depends on Conceptual Exercises, Pre-Labs, STATA Labs, Canvas Assignments (Quizzes, Surveys, Reading Reactions), and a Group Project. However, in all reality, it really depends on the 4 quizzes that you take throughout the term. good. the mix between discussion and lecture was great. flipped classroom worked very well. – ideal. All lecture. Could incorporate some more questions. As mentioned earlier, I really appreciated being able to discuss topics - however I think sometimes too much discussion time was budgeted and we\'d talk about whatever the question was and then have like 5-10 minutes of just talking about non-class topics because we\'d already finished/answered the question. Good. Good balance for a statistics class between the two. Good mix. Good mix between lectures and practice. Good mix, loved the group focus. Good mixture. Great mix between lectures and individual and group work. Half lecture, half in class labs in STATA. I really liked the structure of this class. I think it is unique in that it wasn\'t entirely lecture-based, and instead relied on the flipped classroom structure. I had never had experience with this before, but it really helped me absorb and understand the material. I thought it was a good mix. I thought it was much more discussion and groupwork than I expected coming into this class, in the best possible way. Definitely made statistics/econometrics more fun! I thought the mix between lecture and data exercises was good. It is mainly lecture with some labs. Lectures and labs!. Lectures+labs+active learning classes+online lectures+project. Mainly lecture with some STATA lab. More discussion!. Mostly lecture but also labs. Mostly lecture, but small group discussions for labs and short review problems before class. Mostly lecture, some in-class work. Some flipped format. Mostly lecture. The class had the perfect mix of lecture and discussion. The mixture between lecture and discussion is fair. The structure of the class was good. We met a lot of times, almost always using the x-hour. There is a great mix between lecture and in-class exercises/discussion. This is helpful particularly when the content gets challenging. discussion, lecture. Good. good. mostly working in class, which for this class was helpful as we had learning fellow and prof to help us with problems. learned stats. needed it for the major and it will likely be useful post-Dartmouth as well. really enjoyed the mathy side of economics. - It was probbly less painful than econometrics in other schools. Allow me to read economics research papers independently and changed my understanding of the world. Definitely will be completing econ major, may even do research. Great class. Didnt really influence me that much, but I am happy that professor lewis teaches this class. I am considering looking into doing economics research. I feel like the course was a very solid introduction to STATA and econometrics for me. I really enjoyed taking this and I hope that I can do economic research. I will be looking to apply the tools I learned in my seminar class next term. I will continue to take Economics courses to get the major, and I feel like this helped me get a strong understanding of the material for when I do my own research in 46. I\'m not really sure if I\'m that interested in Economics. Interested in continuing Econometrics work at Dartmouth. It better prepared me for future coursework in the Economics department and now I feel ready to take on independent research. It made me choose not to be an Econ major. It was a good course. It was a good course and I think it\'s made me well-prepared to start doing statistical research. It was very effective at improving my quantitative skills and has been directly helpful for my research fellowship. It wasn\'t easy but I learned a lot. Professor Lewis really got me through it. Learned stats. Made me realize I could be a successful Econ major when I did well. More interested in economic research now. N/A. Had to take it... Positively, I feel i genuinely learned alot about statistics, and had a much better experience than ECON 10. Probably my favorite course here so far. Still plan on being econ double major with cs. Now I can also participate in DERS and hopefully become a Presidential Scholar too. Taught me a great new skill! This class honestly made me to start hating Economics, and had me consider even dropping the major. This course encouraged me and excited me to pursue econometrics research with a professor or in my 40 level class. This course showed me how economics can be applied in the real world. I also really enjoyed learning STATA, which I think will be useful for me down the line in my academic and professional career. This is my favorite class that I\'ve taken at Dartmouth so far. I decided to major in Economics because of it. The class (Econ 20) has an informal reputation for being very difficult, but I thought the way the professor taught it and gave resources for examination preparation made it very manageable, engaging, and interesting. Was one of the more challenging but fulfilling courses I\'ve taken got me interested in econ research! it did not. useful. Lewis is a super chill guy and a great prof. Your grade is really only made up of a group research paper, the 4 quizzes, and the final. Lowest quiz grade is dropped. For all the other assignments he posts the answers before they\'re due and if you show you at least tried hard you get an 100. Lectures are kinda helpful but he teaches a lot more than you need to know for the exams. He gives out tons and tons of previous quizzes and midterms which are super helpful for studying purposes. Really good at explaining stuff. You really are just competing with your class for an A however since he only gives out a set amount of them, so this class is super brutal in that way. The B median is really harshly enforced for this class. Definitely take this class with Lewis if you can! If you want this class to be easy, take it during the summer! Vollrath is super chill and you basically just review concepts from Econ 10. He\'s a visiting prof and is funny and laid back. I thought 20 was way easier than 10. Weekly problem sets, two tests, and a final paper (sounds like more work than it is, it really wasn\'t bad). He\'s a fair grader but of course there\'s the department median. If you have to take 20, take it during your sophomore summer! This class is quite hard, but I definitely learned a lot. Lewis\'s tests were very tough- they are half multiple choice, half free response. The multiple choice are basically just true/false because one question can have multiple/no answers. This part could be pretty brutal, but the free response was usually straight forward. He is a good professor and is a really good guy. He is also pretty helpful during office hours. HIs labs/problem sets are all graded extremely leniently, so basically your entire grade is your exam performance. This is both good and bad- it is nice to not need to stress about making every single assignment perfect, but this makes the class curve more harsh. He publishes tons of practice exams for every test, and those exams will cover everything he will possibly ask you. If you do all of those practice exams, and understand everything, you will be fine. The practice exams were 100 times more helpful than any other sort of studying, so definitely leave yourself tons of time to do all of them. The class lecture material could be pretty complex day to day, but the practice exams made it clear which material you actually needed to know, and what was just him proving something that was unnecessary ( and 75% of the class understood almost none of). He also is a stickler about the grade distribution. I am pretty sure it\'s the only class I have taken here where 1/3 of the class actually gets a C, 1/3 B, 1/3 A. People say that taking this class sophomore summer makes it easier, but you will definitely not learn as much. Overall I thought Econ 20 had potential, but as currently structured by the econ department and Professor Dinkelman, it was a bit frustrating. The class had only three problem sets, which made learning the math concepts difficult, as we would go weeks without practicing the material. The class used Stata, which is a widely used tool for statistical analysis (sort of similar to R) We only learned Stata from powerpoints and a few questions on problem sets. In other words, we didn’t learn much Stata. The textbook was different from the lectures and much more dense. The problems in the textbook were very different from the exams. Hence it was hard to prepare for exams except using the two practice tests provided for each exam. Professor Dinkelman was approachable and did a good job answering students questions. Overall though, if you have the opportunity to take the class with Prof. Ethan Lewis or another prof who structures the class better, do it. I’ve heard Lewis has more problem sets that help students and does a better job breaking down this dense but potentially useful material. Professor Lewis is engaging and really knows his stuff. His lectures are interesting and effective. Would definitely recommend taking 20 with Lewis. Workload: A lot of completion grades which are really not that hard: answering some basic questions based on class material and a few basic STATA assignments. Lewis really walks you through STATA, so you don\'t need any experience going in. There is lots of time in class to work on STATA stuff. The group project and individual project use STATA, but there is so much help that it\'s not a problem. Material: Seems difficult at first, but this class does not really focus on the Math behind the statistics, just how to do them and interpret the results. The lecture notes provide all the gory detail if you want it for interest, but you don\'t need any of it for exams. There are 4 Quiz/Midterms throughout the term, dropping the lowest of the 4. Lewis\'s Multiple Choice/True-False are pretty difficult and it definitely takes a while to get the hang of them, so you really need to do the practice exams (of which he provides plenty). A lot of the day-to-day assignments are pretty much completion grades, so the midterms and final really determine your grade, and with the ability to drop the lowest score and the fact that the class is curved, your grade comes down to doing well on the final which is pretty difficult. Vollrath is a visiting professor during the summer and is laid back in everything he does. Tries to make jokes in class with his deadpan humor and is actually pretty funny at times. The workload for this class is next to nothing on a week to week basis. Six problem sets over ten weeks and he goes over the answers in class before the pset is even due. The hard part of the class is that it is a forced curve (sometimes a B, sometimes a B+) and the material can be tricky. Highly reccommend this class over soph summer so you can spend more time outside. Just make sure to study up before the tests. Oh, and no final exam, just a paper that really wasnt too much work.  Best class I have ever taken at dartmouth. Not a layup but you learn a ton and you see the world differently after that. Amazing learning experience, thumbs up. Lewis explains concepts very intuitively. However his tests are very hard. He nitpicks so remember that when doing the multiple choice questions.  I actually really liked this class. Definitely more challenging than your typical econ class, but I learned a lot. The material was pretty interesting. For some reason, this class has a reputation for essentially being a math class, but for anyone who\'s taken math at Dartmouth, it\'s not-- it\'s much more conceptual than it is computational or proof-based. Lewis is a great lecturer, and I\'d definitely recommend taking the class with him. He has a quirky sense of humor, which was occasionally refreshing in class. He\'s also always very willing to help during office hours. Reading the textbook was completely unnecessary-- just study the slides really well and you\'ll be fine in class. Exams were difficult, but Lewis posted around 8 past midterms online for practice before each test, and doing all of them really helped. Course: The course was interesting enough, though as far as economics courses go it\'s pretty dry. It\'s 90% math and experimental design...really, I thought it was more like an extension of AP statistics than economics-based. Professor: Vollrath was super chill, though his lectures were pretty boring--just reading off the slide. If you can read and figure out the slides yourself you can get away with only showing up to lecture for the quizzes and homework. Workload: Weekly problem set (graded for completion only), weekly 10-question quiz, 2 exams, and a final project. Everything was pretty easy until the final project, which was much harder than the quizzes and exams. Course: This material was interesting for me as a math person, but most econ majors find it dull. It is very fast paced and there is a ton of material to learn. Its a tough class, but its graded on the Econ curve. Professor: I really liked Professor Lewis. He\'s really smart and kind of goofy. Sometimes he fails to explain a concept as clearly as you would like, but in general, he teaches the material well. Make sure to print out the slides before class because you won\'t have time to copy all the notes down in class. Workload: Problem sets were manageable. There was a good amount of Stata use, but usually Professor Lewis walks you through the steps. Exams were definitely tough, but the paper is pretty simple. Made everything intuitive Made reading the book irrelevant Great prof Really interesting stuff (but that\'s just me). Since this was the first time Lewis taught the class, things were a little disorganized, but that shouldn\'t be a problem for future sections of this course. Most of the learning was done after class, as it was hard to follow his lectures, but his slides are usually quite thorough. His exams take some getting used to, and it will hurt you dearly if you get many multiple choice wrong. He makes up for it by giving straight forward free responses, though you\'re usually in a crunch for time by the time you get to those. The final was a lot better and not as time pressured. For the first midterm, a good econ 10 background (preferrably with Lewis) probably helps. After that, everything is new, and econ 10 concepts aren\'t really tested. A good thing about this class is that he isn\'t too big on STATA, and doesn\'t include STATA problems on the exams. Overall, I recommend this prof. but beware that his exams will be tough. That being said, only your percentile matters for the final grade. He told us that the median would be a B, but with all the extra credit he gave, it was pushed up to the standard B+ median. Summary: Course: A- Professor: B Most people take this course because they are Economics majors and they must. However, that is NOT the only good reason to take it. The statistical methods covered are useful, interesting, and in high demand by many employers. More than that, though, they provide you a powerful way of looking at the world through data and inference, one that I find absolutely fascinating. The class is a very thorough journey through basic and intermediate econometrics, and it is built entirely around multiple regression analysis. Professor Anderson is knowledgeable and is good at explaining econometrics in both plain and technical language. However, her attitude was often negative and sometimes outright unhelpful. Overall, while the course is fairly difficult and requires you to be at least somewhat quantitatively oriented, the skills it provides are incredibly useful. If you can push through the math and appreciate the power of statistics, it can be very enjoyable! The Professor Professor Anderson is a mix of good and bad. On the positive side, she is adept at explaining the material in a variety of ways. She can talk theory and formulas with the best of them, but she prefers a more grounded approach that is intuitive to those of us who are not completely comfortable with math. She is decently responsive in class, and she moves at an excellent pace, summarizing the previous lecture at the beginning of each class to help you segway into the next. On the negative side, she has a bit of an attitude problem. She is not the most riveting lecturer, and she often becomes awkwardly negative when we fail to respond to her jokes and attempts at classroom discussion. With a subject as potentially dry as econometrics, itâ€™s difficult to tolerate too much of that negativity. Overall, though, she does a good job of conveying the material in a way that is thorough and intuitive. The Course The class covers everything you always wanted to know about econometrics but were afraid to ask. It is based entirely around regression analysis, including interpretation of results, ways to test models for problems such as heteroskedasticity or functional form problems, how to correct for those problems, and how to use different types of estimators (OLS, fixed effects, probit, etc.) in different situations. Though it covers quite a bit of material fairly quickly, the class if organized in a logical way and is reasonably easy to follow if you keep up with the material on a day-to-day basis. Three very important notes: (1) Many people skipped class this term, but I would advise against that. The extra insight and opportunities to ask questions in class helped me tremendously. (2) The book is extremely helpful! When I took ECON 10, I never used the book, but not so with ECON 20. It features not only detailed descriptions of the derivation of formulas (not so useful) but also qualitative, intuitive discussions of how to use them (very useful!). (3) Anderson posts several practice tests to help you study for exams. Do them! I learned more from those tests (which I often failed on the first try) than I did from any other single aspect of the course. I have to include a note defending econometrics against the inevitable accusations that it is â€œdryâ€ or that you should only take this class â€œsince you have to.â€ Econometric theory is, in and of itself, admittedly quite dry. But only when you start getting your hands dirty in the data do you realize the true power of statistics to inform our understanding of the world. How else could you answer questions like â€œHow many years does smoking a pack per day shave off your life?â€ or â€œWhat is the projected demand for electricity in 20 years?â€ Statistics allows you to make VERY educated guesses about interesting and complex questions that you could not answer with direct observation. In essence, it allows you to see more than your senses will allow. This course gives you a great overview of many useful econometric techniques, and for me it was far from boring. Besides, apply for any consulting or economic research job, and you will quickly find that econometrics (and literacy in Stata, which this course uses heavily) is in high demand. Grading The course had two mid-terms, each worth 25%, and a final worth 35%. These were fair and thorough exams that did a good job of assessing our knowledge of the topics covered, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A group paper takes up 10%, along with a final 5% of your grade for â€œparticipation,â€ which essentially means reading articles, doing problem sets, and coming to class with answers prepared for both. Everyone complains about this class and its for good reason. The book is almost completely pointless. Patty Anderson treats the class a little differently in that she de-emphasizes the project and focuses more on the tests. This is probably a bad thing because her tests tend to be tricky and long, even though they are open-book open-note. She was also really harsh in grading the projects.  I liked this class. Debopam wants to scare you the first day by saying you have to have econ 10 mastered to do this course, but that\'s not really true. Just do the homeworks, and the exams mostly emphasize understanding the intuition behind things, which I liked. It\'s dry, but that\'s to be expected. Debopam\'s a good prof. Previous reviews have labeled Professor Bhattacharya as horribly dry and uninspiring; I beg to differ. I think he has made an effort to make the subject matter a lot more interesting and bring it down to a level applicable for college seniors. He\'s definitely fair in grading with respect to what he warns you about before the tests, and will curve them fairly. Paying attention in class definitely helps, and he\'s good at making the exams very similar to practice tests and homeworks. He\'s somewhat funny too. The class definitely could have been a lot worse, I think the reason it wasn\'t was Bhattacharya. I liked this class. Debopam wants to scare you the first day by saying you have to have econ 10 mastered to do this course, but that\'s not really true. Just do the homeworks, and the exams mostly emphasize understanding the intuition behind things, which I liked. It\'s dry, but that\'s to be expected. Debopam\'s a good prof.  I like Prof Debopam\'s intuitive way of teaching economics. His explanation was quite clear, and the exams were not too difficult because everything was either from his lecture or in the textbook. A pretty good econometrics course for students who are not extremely good at math. Breakdown of the class: 2 midterms (40%) project (20%) final (40%) Everything is worth 20 points, with the final being 20 questions and 40 points. Debop is a funny, little man, who presents the material as clearly as he can. The tests were all open note, open book, but he only takes intuitive answers, so you need to work on the material more than other classes. He tried to scare people the first day by saying that you can\'t take other hard classes with this one, but it is definitely manageable. I also suggest studying with other people for the tests..it really helps. The biggest thing is to be patient and put the work into the class. And if you don\'t have to take it, don\'t! Econ 20 is reputed to be one of the worst econ classes, but prof. bhattacharya made it interesting and emphasized intuitive understanding of the material. He\'s the best econ prof I\'ve had so far. You don\'t have to read the book, so there isn\'t much daily homework, just studying for the tests (2) and doing a big written project applying the material. Like most people taking ECON20 this term, I was pretty terrified the first day of class. However, the class turned out to be interesting, Professor Bhattacharya MUCH better than I expected, and overall it was less work than I anticipated. The material is dry, certainly, but if you are interested in policy analysis, the material of this course is interesting and essential to any future work you might do. Don\'t be afraid of Professor Bhattacharya--he may be less warm and fuzzy than many professors at Dartmouth, but he always wants you to ask questions and is VERY helpful if you go to office hours--I strongly encourage going. Do the homework problems and go to class--some test questions are directly from the homework or class notes, and since tests are open note it\'s really too bad if you miss easy ones like these. Study with other people for the tests. I think most people take this course because they have to. Prof Bhattacharya is okay. His lectures are fairly good in that he explains the material well. That being said he is reluctant to repeat anything and is not as open to answering questions as he claims to be. He has a review session before each test but a lot of people are too afraid to ask anything since he will ask you what you think. He ended most classes atleast 10 minutes early. There are 6 problem sets, two midterms and a final. Average on the midterms and final are generally low (Ex. 13/20 on one of our midterms) and there are a few questions so it\'s kind of hard to do well. BUT everything is scaled to a B+ average so it\'s generally fair. Do all the practice problems and old exams that he gives since they are very helpful and he often repeats questions on tests. He uses all the same material that Anderson uses (her name is still written on all the slides he posted on blackboard). The class is tough basically because the material is so dry and boring, and debop warns you in the beginning that that\'s the way it\'s going to be. The tests aren\'t too bad if you do the problem sets and practice tests but you really have to understand the concepts. The group project is the worst part about this class. It is so open-ended and so hard to divvy up work and it ends up taking a lot longer than you think it will. All that said, people who take this class have to take it, so it\'s definitely do-able, but you just have to get through it. Prof. Bhattarcharya makes the course sound dry and boring from the outset, but I think the professor has more to do with that than the material itself. Though it may not be in his character, I wish he would engage the class more and moreover utilize the full lecture time. He could have better solidified our understanding with the remaining ten or fifteen minutes. The class itself is definitely one of the more challenging economics classes. He expects you to do a lot of work and tries to scare you off at the beginning. I didn\'t find it too hard as long as you keep up with the work. However, he can be somewhat unfair and unresponsive to students. The final is probably what will ruin you.
