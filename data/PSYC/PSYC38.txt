Interesting course material, but Professor Robertson might be the worst professor I\'ve had at Dartmouth. Her lectures are awful, she can be condescending and downright mean at times, some times it seems she genuinely has no clue what she\'s talking about, and on the first test, she just simply didn\'t give us enough time and most people finished. She apologized to us for it but no grades were changed so didn\'t really matter. The workload isn\'t too bad just a reading or two before every class. With a different prof I would recommend this class, but if its Professor Robertson, I would take a different class. Really regret taking this class. I normally do pretty well in my neuro classes, but Professor Robertson made the material incredibly difficult to grasp.
