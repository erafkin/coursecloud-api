This class had an absolutely unique format. It\'s very fast paced with dense readings, but instead of a normal lecture class, we broke into teams and worked through problem sets based on the readings. I really enjoyed the change of pace from most neuro classes I\'ve taken so far. Prof Clark is brilliant and an excellent teacher. The downside to this class is that it is INTENSE. Lots of reading in short amounts of time, which we are tested on before we start applying it. The midterms are long problem sets that average C medians. I loved this class and it\'s mandatory for the neuroscience major, but I suggest taking it during a term where you have enough time to really focus on it. This is not a class you skate through.
