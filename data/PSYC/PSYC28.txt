Prof Brown is great- she\'s very energetic, young, and knows the material well. The tests weren\'t too tricky and she stresses at the beginning that this will actually be a really hard psych class. Don\'t let this scare you because it\'s really not. You get in a group of 4ish to present an experiment in a published paper that you all found interesting and related to the chapter you sign up for to the huge class once throughout the term. This is called a Data Blitz don\'t ask me why though because I couldn\'t tell you. Unfortunately, she has about 3 student groups do their presentation during each X hour so we always used the X hour which is not fun. Didn\'t go to one class after the first midterm. Super easy to just study lectures posted on Canvas and textbook before exams. Exams are extremely straightforward if you follow her study guide and do all the chapter readings/lectures. Would definitely recommend this course as a layup. The material is also pretty interesting and Dr. Brown is really nice/gives dynamic lectures. Its like Psyc 2 in that it is the same format and level of work as Psyc 1 was, but its just the next step of information. Bharucha is an interesting prof if you can follow along, but sometimes you will sit through a whole class and have no idea what he talked about the entire time, (maybe that was just me..?). Study for exams mostly from the textbook, but also look over in-class notes. Not a layup but also not super difficult to get an A if you do the reading and get good class notes, (from a friend or your own).
